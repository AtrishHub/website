		<h3>Friday night</h3>
		<h4>6pm for 7pm start</h4>
		<p>This is a must. You can’t take part in the hack if you miss out on Friday night! Form a team, choose a problem, have a drink if you fancy, get started. When you choose a problem, you will need to figure out what ‘done’ means, and how you will test it.</p>

		<h3>Saturday &amp; Sunday</h3>
		<h4>From 9am &mdash; late</h4>
		<p>All the wifi, coffee and food your heart desires. Plenty of developer tools and support. Experts in research and technology will be around to act as data custodians and problem owners, as well as facilitators to help teams focus and move through problems. Saturday evening: checkpoint. Stop for a break, tell everyone where you’re at, maybe find someone to exchange skills with. Sunday evening:THE END! showcase! prizes! drinks!</p>

		<h3>Saturday checkpoint</h3>
		<h4>3-4pm</h4>
		<p>Some suggested problems will be on the site beforehand so you can start thinking about what and how to tackle. There will also be pointers to the free datasets available online if you’d rather choose something freeform – and a bunch of scientists will be around on the weekend to help, guide and mentor.</p>
