title: Judging Criteria
---



<div markdown="block">

## Entries will be judged according to the following criteria, each scored out of 5.

### 1. Quality of Idea
How are you approaching the problem? Can your solution be generalised to solve similar problems? Will it generate excitement? Are you being creative in your approach?

### 2. Quality of Execution
What have you delivered this weekend? To what extent have you solved the problem? Have you delivered a working web application or just a prototype with static HTML pages? Have you got working, documented code in a GitHub repository with a nice readme, or just a scrappy mess?

### 3. Is it a Health Hack?
Does your solution fulfil the spirit and substance of HealthHack? Is it open? Did you work to solve a problem in collaboration with a researcher?
