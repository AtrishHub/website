       <h2 class="lead">A datahack for medical research problems</h2>
	   <p>HealthHack is a weekend datahack working on problems that medical researchers face. Medical researchers create vast amounts of data, but don’t always have good ways to analyse, visualise and communicate it. On the weekend we’ll have available for you real life medical researchers, their problems, their data.</p>

		<h3>Where and when?</h3>
		<p>Fri 25 Oct – Sun 27 Oct, at ThoughtWorks office, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?t=m&amp;q=ThoughtWorks+Melbourne,+Collins+Street,+Melbourne,+Victoria,+Australia&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=ThoughtWorks+Melbourne,+Collins+Street,+Melbourne,+Victoria,+Australia&amp;cid=13675112721718773594&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=-37.816361,144.964085&amp;spn=0.020341,0.025749&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A&amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">15/303 Collins St Melbourne</a></p>
		<h3>How will it work?</h3>
		<p><strong>Before:</strong> Some suggested problems will be on the site beforehand so you can start thinking about what and how to tackle. There will also be pointers to the free datasets available online if you’d rather choose something freeform – and a bunch of scientists will be around on the weekend to help, guide and mentor.</p>
		<p><strong>Friday night:</strong> This is a must. You can’t take part in the hack if you miss out on Friday night! Form a team, choose a problem, have a drink if you fancy, get started. When you choose a problem, you will need to figure out what ‘done’ means, and how you will test it.</p>
		<p><strong>Saturday &amp; Sunday:</strong> All the wifi, coffee and food your heart desires. Plenty of developer tools and support. Experts in research and technology will be around to act as data custodians and problem owners, as well as facilitators to help teams focus and move through problems. Saturday evening: checkpoint. Stop for a break, tell everyone where you’re at, maybe find someone to exchange skills with. Sunday evening:THE END! showcase! prizes! drinks!</p>

		<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
		<p>Health Hack is open to everyone and anyone. From data vis, designers and UX’ers, through to web developers and hard core application developers. Never participated in one of these things before? A bit of a newbie? Perfect; come along. Pull a team together to tackle some fascinating problems in medical research. Build your own mashups, data visualisations and apps. HealthHack is about having fun and learning, regardless of your level of expertise. From first year university students through to hardened developers, everyone who gets involved will come away from the weekend with something new, whether it be code, content, an idea or new contacts.</p>
		<h4>Can I participate remotely?</h4>
		<p>Yes you can! Form your own team where you are, or find a team in Melbourne to work with on Friday night. We’ll have video link facilities. If you know any scientists near you who would like to participate, all the better. If you’d like to be involved remotely, please get in touch with us ahead of time so we can organise All The Things.</p>

	<h3>Problems you can help solve</h3>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h4>I want to display a heap of genetic information at once…</h4>
		<p>We need a simple and highly visually effective software package to display genetic and epigenetic marks, where we can view many different layers of information at once, and easily switch between viewing a single region of one gene, to viewing many genes, to even viewing a whole chromosome.</p>
		<p>There are many publicly available datasets that could be used to create such visualisation software, and it would be worth considering the currently available systems for viewing such data (e.g. Galaxy, UCSC Genome Browser, IGV, SeqMonk). While each of these has its benefits, none provide a holistic view of the data that allows optimal visualisation. *Every cell in the body contains all the genes of the genome – the entire DNA content of a cell – but not every cell in the body is the same. For example, a heart cell is very different to a neuron. How can these cells be so different if they all contain the same genes?</p>
		<p>The answer is that each cell type turns on, or uses, a distinct set of genes. This means that each cell type makes its own complement of protein products that help determine the cell type’s function.</p>
		<p>So what controls whether a gene is turned on or off? We know this is influenced by how easily accessible the gene is to the factors required to turn the gene on: the more tightly packaged the gene is, the less likely it is to be accessible to factors that bind and activate it, and the less likely it will be turned on.* *We now know that the different packaging of the DNA can be correlated with various marks that are made to the DNA, called ‘epigenetic marks’. These epigenetic marks can be considered as punctuation marks in the genome – they allow the cell to interpret how to read the information contained in the DNA sequence. Due to transformational changes in the way we examine these marks throughout the whole genome, biologists are creating a wealth of data that reports not only the DNA sequence, but also the amount of various epigenetic marks, and the amount of different factors bound to the DNA throughout the whole genome. This landslide of data is highly complex, and difficult for bench biologists to interrogate.</p>

		<h4>Here is a bunch of problems that geneticists would love help with!</h4>
		<p>Inside each cell in our body are more than 30,000 genes (the ‘genome’) that are expressed in different levels to control a wide range of processes. An example of this may be the differentiation of blood cells: a single blood stem cell in the bone marrow can give rise to many different mature blood cells, progressively developing from progenitors with the potential to become many different cells, to mature cells with very specialised functions. What key genes are turned on and off at various stages of differentiation? Can we associate functions of these cells with their genomic profiles?</p>
		<p>Using whole genome techniques to measure the expression levels of all the genes in a cell, we can gather expression values of all the genes across a variety of cell types as a matrix of values. Then we can analyse this data in multiple ways to obtain biological meaning and generate hypothesis. As a simple example, suppose that a gene is expressed highly only in a single cell type out of many. Perhaps this implies that this gene is crucial in creating these cells, and blocking the action of this gene may lead to therapeutic outcomes if too many of these cells cause disease. Hence we need tools to be able to look at this data in different ways. We also want to empower the biologists without programming background to carry out some analysis in intuitive ways. So here are some questions which may have tractable answers over a weekend of coding, based on a matrix of gene expression values:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>Use d3 (javascript) to plot expression profile of a gene in various ways – eg. quickly switch between bar plots and box plots, change presentation based on the “aggregation” metric (sum over strains or mutation status, for example). Input could simply be a dictionary of values corresponding to one row of the matrix mentioned above.</li>
		    <li>Many genes work together to create a phenotype, and there are many ways of grouping genes into “networks”. Some common ways of creating gene networks also create visualisation challenges, due to the sheer number of possible points and connections. In this context, evaluate some commonly used network visualisation tools such as a minimum spanning tree diagram on iOS and other tablet and handheld platforms. Input could be a graph which comprises of a set of nodes and edges. What can and can’t the tablet devices do compared to the mouse/keyboard combinations?</li>
		    <li>Correlation calculations are often performed on subsets of the matrix mentioned above. The high number of possible subset combinations make such calculations often quite slow. What strategies could be employed to speed up the performances these calculations?</li>
		    <li>Clustering is often performed on genes, but not very often on cells. However for large datasets, clustering on cells is very useful for the biologist. What ideas could we explore to visualise clusters of related cells based on quantitative measures such as correlations?</li>
		    <li>Heatmaps are often used to show clusters in a matrix of data, but they often have limited usefulness. Can we come up with some new ways of creating heatmaps?</li>
		    <li>Many of the bioinformatics methods are developed in R and deployed as R packages. What are some practically useful implementation strategies for deploying applications, which can provide the user with interface tools such as d3, while leveraging R as the analysis engine?</li>
		</ul>
