### Friday night ###

#### 6pm for 7pm start ####

This is a must. You can’t take part in the hack if you miss out on Friday night! Form a team, choose a problem, have a drink if you fancy, get started. When you choose a problem, you will need to figure out what ‘done’ means, and how you will test it.

### Saturday & Sunday ###

#### From 9am &mdash; late ####

All the wifi, coffee and food your heart desires. Plenty of developer tools and support. Experts in research and technology will be around to act as data custodians and problem owners, as well as facilitators to help teams focus and move through problems.

#### 3-4pm ####

Stop for a break, tell everyone where you’re at, maybe find someone to exchange skills with.

### Sunday evening ###

#### Tools down 4pm ####

THE END! showcase! prizes! drinks!
